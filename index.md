Hi there, I'm Noah. I am a candidate for a Master of Behavioral and Decision Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, set to graduate in December 2020. During the summer of 2020, I am serving as a Graduate TA for [Wharton's Moneyball Academy](https://github.com/Wharton-Moneyball/Wharton-Moneyball.github.io).

Before enrolling at Penn, I completed two Bachelor's degrees at TCU - a BS in Economics and a BA in Mathematics and Psychology - and worked for TCU Baseball in events, equipment, and data tracking. During my gap year between TCU and Penn, I worked full-time with a marketing firm and part-time with the Texas Rangers and as a tutor. My passions include brand-building and spreading the joy of sports. On this site, I have included some data analysis projects for baseball and marketing. Enjoy!
